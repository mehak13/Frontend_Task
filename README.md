#Approach 

The React app follows a component-based architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and reusability. Key components like Navbar, TaskList, and TaskDetail are designed to handle specific functionalities. State management is handled locally using React's useState and props to pass data between components. Filtering, sorting, and CRUD operations are implemented to enhance functionality and provide a seamless user experience.

#Thought Process
1) Structure and Planning:
Break the app into logical components (e.g., Navbar, TaskList, TaskDetail).
Define clear props and state to manage data flow and component communication.
2) Design:
Prioritize user-friendliness and responsiveness.
Ensure consistent styling and visual hierarchy.
3) Functionality:
Implement CRUD operations for tasks.
Provide filters, sorting, and status toggles to enhance task management.
Integrate routing to allow navigation between task list and details.

#Tools Used 
1) React:
Core library for building the app.
React Router for navigation.
2) Ant Design:
Pre-built UI components for faster development and a polished look.
3) CSS:
Custom styling for components and responsiveness using media queries.
4) Browser Developer Tools:
Debugging and testing the appâ€™s responsiveness and functionality.
5) Code Editor:
VS Code for writing, managing, and debugging the code.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
